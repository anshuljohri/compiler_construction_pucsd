How To Build:   To Build executable file type "make" on command prompt.

Execute The Parser: It  Gives Executable File Named "Nothing".

Known Problems:   Sorry sir yet i havn't handeled the Function and Procedure           identifiers. Except this there is no problem. I have handeled the normal variables. Maintained scope and give errors if any variable is not declared and it is used or if it is out of scope.  

Test Run Results:  Give "make check" on command prompt. It generates                                      "output.txt", which contains the results of testcases.
